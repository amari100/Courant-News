Quick install guide
===================

To use Courant News, you'll have to install it. Before that, we'll need to
install some other software which it relies upon. This guide will walk you
through these steps, and point you to references where you can find more
information where appropriate.

Install Python
--------------

Courant News is written in the Python programming language, so the first order
of business is installing Python itself. We recommend either version 2.5 or 2.6,
due to compatibility concerns with some of the software that Courant News uses.

We do not currently support Python 3.0, as our primary dependency (the Django_
web framework) does not currently support it. When Django begins to support
Python 3.0, we will evaluate the transition ourselves. Until then, you will
be more than fine with Python 2.5 or 2.6

.. _django: http://www.djangoproject.com/

You can get Python at http://www.python.org. Most versions of Linux and Mac OS X
come with Python pre-installed. To verify that you have Python installed, you
can type ``python`` from a terminal or command-line program. You should see
something like::

    Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Oct  5 2008, 19:29:17)
    [GCC 4.3.2] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Install Source Control Tools
----------------------------

Courant News and other software projects rely upon certain tools to manage
their code and collaboration between developers. Two of the popular tools
are Subversion_ (svn) and Git_. Although Courant News itself uses svn, a number
of third-party libraries that we depend on use git.

.. _subversion: http://subversion.tigris.org/
.. _git: http://git-scm.com/

To install svn, you can find an appropriate download at their `download
website <http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#binary-packages>`_. You can
confirm that your installation has worked by running ``svn help`` at your
terminal or command-line program.

Similarly, you can install git by choosing the appropriate link at their
`download page <http://git-scm.com/download>`_. Windows users should probably
choose the `msysGit <http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list>`_ version.
You can confirm that your installation has worked by running ``git`` at your
terminal or command-line program.

Install Database
----------------

Instructions can be found in the Django `database installation <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/#database-installation>`_
documentation section. We strongly recommend the use of PostgreSQL, but most
of the Courant News functionality has been tested against MySQL as well. 

Install Courant
---------------

We're finally ready to install Courant News itself, along with the other
Python software that it runs on and with. To simplify the process, we have
created a bootstrapping script to handle most of the process. The script
creates a virtualenv_ directory into which everything will be installed.
virtualenv isolates the software from the rest of your system, preventing
conflicts with other Python software you may have installed, and allowing simple
removal of the entire system by just deleting the virtualenv directory.

.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/

Bootstrapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get started, download the bootstrapping file from the Courant News
source code repository: `courant-boot.py`_. Save it wherever is convenient,
preferrably somewhere that you have easy access. 

.. _courant-boot.py: http://code.courantnews.com/export/latest/trunk/setup/courant-boot.py

In the following examples, we are going to install into a virtualenv called
`site-env` and a site called `mynews`, but you can call them whatever you wish.
The most common scenario for a beginner would be to start with the sample
"default" project site that Courant News bundles. To do this, run the following
from your terminal/command-line (after moving to the directory where you
downloaded the courant-boot.py file)::

    python courant-boot.py site-env -n mynews -p default
    
This will create the virtualenv, install some support software, download the
latest version of Courant News, download and install all third-party libraries
(including Django and others), and make a fresh copy of the default project in
the root of the `site-env` virtualenv.

Additional Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The bootstrapping script takes a number of options to control its behavior.
Running ``python courant-boot.py`` will give a full listing, including
descriptions of each. Following are some of the most commonly used.

Project Source
""""""""""""""

The ``-p`` parameter can be either the name of a bundled project template,
as used above, or it can be a URL to a source code repository housing your
site's project code. We strongly recommend that organizations use a source
control tool, and this parameter allows for easy integration::

    python courant-boot.py site-env -n mynews -p svn://svn.mynews.com/trunk
    
The URL can be of any format supposed by `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/requirement-format.html#version-control>`_,
including Subversion, Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar repositories as of this time.
The URL can also be a path to a directory on your computer, allowing you to
link the Courant News virtualenv with code elsewhere on your computer that may
be more convenient::

    python courant-boot.py site-env -n mynews -p ~/mynews/trunk
    
Note: pip currently does not support repositories that require authentication.
In cases where your project's repository requires authentication to do a checkout,
you will have to do the checkout manually. When pip supports authenticated checkouts,
we will add support for such behavior.
    
External Requirements
"""""""""""""""""""""

The ``-r`` or ``--requirements`` flag allows you to enable the fetching of the
external dependencies required for Courant News to operate properly. This flag
is implicit and enabled by default, so you should never need to use it directly.

However, you may want to skip the fetching of these external requirements, as
that may be a lengthy process. You can do so by passing the ``--skip-requirements``
flag::
    
    python courant-boot.py site-env --skip-requirements
    
This is probably most useful when you wish to update to the latest version of
Courant News or update your project's code (by including the ``-n`` and ``-p``
parameters as seen above).

For Courant News Development
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For those who want or need to work on the code of Courant News itself, the ``-c``
or ``--courant`` parameter allows you to specify a file path to where you have
a copy of the Courant News repository checked out. This will create a link to
that folder instead of creating and installed a bundled (Python egg) version, so
that you can work on the code separately.

Configure Project
-----------------

After installing Courant News and creating your site's project, you will have to
configure the site by modifying the settings file. If you started from one of
the bundled project templates, you will find a settings file template in
``settings/local_settings.py.dist``. You will want to make a copy of this file
and save it as ``settings/local_settings.py``.

Then open this file in your favorite text editor and tweak the settings as
appropriate. Be sure to adjust the database settings. You can find more
information regarding settings files in the Django documentation's settings
`overview <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/#topics-settings>`_
and `settings reference <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#ref-settings>`_.

That's it

You are now ready to build your news site. A tutorial covering the basics will
be coming soon.
