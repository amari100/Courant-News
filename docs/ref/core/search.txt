    :synopsis: Powerful search of all content types.
    
Courant News currently builds upon `Haystack <http://haystacksearch.org/>`_
search library, which allows for use of various search backend options
depending on your hosting situation and needs.

For example, if you are on shared hosting that does not allow the installation
of Java or custom C++ programs, you can use the `Whoosh <http://whoosh.ca/>`_
engine, which is python-only. However, if you can use Java, it is recommended
that you use the `Solr <http://lucene.apache.org/solr/>`_ backend, which is far
faster and can handle larger datasets. Read the Haystack documentation
for more information on choosing a backend.

Courant News makes some assumptions about what information to display on the
search results page, but if you desire different behavior, simply define
your own search views, forms, and URLs and include them in your site URLconf.
