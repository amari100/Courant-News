    :synopsis: Allow access to authorized staff while site is publicly unavailable.

This app creates a new user setting that is configurable through the admin
interface which allows for the general disabling of the website. This can be
useful when upgrades must be performed on the server or for extreme situations.

While the site is disabled, only staff members are able to access the website.
All other visitors will instead see your ``500`` error page template.
